template_synthesis_a = """You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of information synthesis from multiple sources. You will evaluate how well a report integrates and synthesizes information from provided source excerpts.

## Scoring Rubric

You will assign a score from 0-4 based on the following criteria:

For any level, **all bullets under that level (and every lower level) must be met**.
If even one required bullet is missing, grade at the next lower level.  
A perfect **4** should be rare (≈ ≤ 10 % of reports).

---

### **0 - Pure extraction (merely copies facts, no synthesis)**
- Discusses each source in isolation; no cross-referencing or linking of ideas  
- Merely restates or paraphrases source content sentence-by-sentence  
- No attempt to weigh, prioritise, or interpret information  
- **Automatic knock-out:** any report that is essentially a stitched-together summary of individual sources  

---

### **1 - Aggregation (lists facts, minimal integration)**
- Draws material from at least two sources but presents it sequentially rather than relationally  
- Groups similar points superficially (e.g., simple bullet clusters)  
- Mentions multiple sources without comparing or contrasting them  
- **Automatic knock-out:** no explicit statements highlighting relationships between sources  

---

### **2 - Basic integration (combines sources, little insight / no conflict resolution)**
- Mixes evidence from multiple sources within thematic sections  
- Makes simple connections (e.g., "Both studies suggest X")  
- Notes—but does not analyse or resolve—conflicting findings  
- Generates only basic, surface-level inferences  
- **Automatic knock-out:** leaves a clear contradiction unaddressed **or** "resolves" it using speculation lacking evidence  

---

### **3 - Solid synthesis (addresses conflicts, some original insight)**
- Interleaves evidence from three or more sources into a single narrative argument  
- Explicitly compares/contrasts sources and justifies why some evidence carries more weight (e.g., based on methodology, sample size, recency)  
- Analytically explains agreements **and** disagreements, offering evidence-based reasoning  
- Produces at least one new takeaway that combines information across sources  
- **Automatic knock-out:** omits discussion of a major, known contradiction among cited sources  

---

### **4 - Expert, insight-rich synthesis (reconciles conflicts, draws novel conclusions)**
- Covers **all** relevant sources for the topic (breadth) while emphasising the highest-quality and most recent evidence (depth)  
- Systematically reconciles every key discrepancy using methodological critique, context, or data-quality considerations  
- Generates multiple original conclusions, frameworks, or hypotheses that do **not** appear in any single source but logically follow from the combined evidence  
- Clearly articulates residual uncertainties, limitations, and potential future directions  
- Demonstrates critical thinking throughout—moving beyond summary to construct a coherent, logically progressive argument  
- **Automatic knock-out:** any unsupported assertion presented as synthesis **or** failure to explain resolution of a critical contradiction  

---

### Usage tips
1. **Grade down** if **any** required bullet under the intended level is missing.  
2. **Grade up** only when every bullet for that level *and below* is satisfied **and** no knock-out conditions apply.  
3. If a report straddles two levels, assign the lower score.


## Source Excerpts

<sources>
{sources}
</sources>

## Report to Evaluate

<report>
{report}
</report>

## Evaluation Process

1. First, carefully read and understand all source excerpts.
2. Then, read the report thoroughly.
3. Analyze how information from the sources has been incorporated into the report:
    - Does it merely copy or paraphrase individual facts?
    - Does it make connections between related information from different sources?
    - Does it identify and resolve conflicts between sources?
    - Does it draw insights or conclusions not explicitly stated in any single source?
4. Consider the overall coherence and depth of understanding demonstrated in the report.
5. Provide a brief but specific rationale for your score.
6. Assign the appropriate score (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the rubric.

## Output Format

Return your evaluation in JSON format as follows:
```json
{{
"rationale": "<brief reason>",
"score": <int 0-4>,
}}
```

Your rationale should be concise (1-3 sentences) but should specifically reference how the report handled information from the sources.
"""

template_synthesis_b = """# Information Synthesis Evaluation

You are tasked with evaluating how well a report synthesizes information from multiple sources. Your goal is to assess the level of insight and integration demonstrated in the report, not just factual accuracy.

## Scoring System
You will assign a score from 0-4 based on the following criteria:
- **0 = Merely copies facts, no synthesis**: The report simply repeats or paraphrases information from the sources without connecting ideas or adding value.
- **2 = Combines sources but little insight**: The report brings together information from different sources but does little to identify patterns, implications, or deeper connections.
- **4 = Expertly synthesizes**: The report not only integrates information across sources but also identifies meaningful patterns, draws insightful conclusions, or provides a novel perspective that adds value beyond what's explicitly stated in the sources.

## Evaluation Criteria
Consider the following when evaluating:
- Does the report identify connections across sources that aren't obvious?
- Does it recognize patterns or themes across the information?
- Does it draw meaningful conclusions that require understanding multiple sources?
- Does it provide context or implications that demonstrate deeper understanding?
- Does it organize information in a way that creates new meaning?
- Does it go beyond summarizing to offer genuine insights?

## Report to Evaluate
Now, read the report that needs evaluation:

<report>
{report}
</report>

## Source Material
First, carefully read these source excerpts:

<sources>
{sources}
</sources>

## Analysis Process
1. First, carefully compare the report to the source material.
2. Identify which elements of the report come from which sources.
3. Analyze how information from different sources is integrated.
4. Determine whether the report adds value beyond what's in the sources.
5. Consider whether connections made across sources demonstrate insight.

## Your Response
Provide your evaluation in JSON format with two fields:
1. "rationale": A brief explanation (1-3 sentences) justifying your score
2. "score": An integer from 0 to 4

Your response should follow this format:
```json
{{
"rationale": "<brief explanation of your reasoning>",
"score": <integer 0-4>,
}}
```
