However, the answer also includes information not present in the reference text, such as the specific molecular signalling pathways in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and tissue-resident macrophages that are dysregulated due to CFTR mutations. This information is not supported by the reference text and is therefore considered a hallucination.",
